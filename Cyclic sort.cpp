//cyclic sort is used when we have to sort an array of size n ,containing (0 to n-1) or (1 to n) elements in array.
//the concept involves matching the element with corresponding indexes of the proper order,
//it is inplace sorting algorithm 
//O(n)
//duplicates is not allowed for this variant.
